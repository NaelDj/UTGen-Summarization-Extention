/**
 * Creates a new instance of the "Rational" class with numerator 1 and denominator 3215.
 * Calls the "abs()" method on the created rational number, which returns a new rational number with the absolute value of the original number.
 * Asserts that the new rational number has a numerator equal to 1.
 * Asserts that the new rational number has a denominator equal to 3215.
 * Converts the new rational number to a float value and asserts that it is approximately equal to 3.11041E-4F, with a tolerance of 0.01F.
