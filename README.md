**Replication Package for extending UTGen with LLM-Generated Summarizations Project**

This is the replication package for [CSE3000 Research Project](https://github.com/TU-Delft-CSE/Research-Project) 2024 version of [Delft University of Technology](https://github.com/TU-Delft-CSE). This includes the prompt used to prompt the large language models, results, and the survey that was used for the user-evaluation.

**Project Description**

T1: Test Summarization with LLMs
Objective: To create concise, natural summarizations of test scenarios using LLMs.

Background: This track builds upon existing research in LLMs applied to software testing. However, DeepTC and Test Describer are two studies that worked on Test Summirization with other techniques like Deep-Learning and Coverage-Base which we want to expand it with using LLMs.
